Duo is a world-famous poliglot who knows the whooping 40+ distinct languages to perfection, (or at least a strong B2 level). He arguably revolutionised the language education. He is well-known and respected in language learning communities around the globe. He gained his fame through his devoted work as language educator and motivator.      
            </p>
            <p>
In his hard work, he takes on various roles: let it be a coach when sharing valuable language learning tips; a mentor - popping out when least expected with the words of encouragement; and a bit of a bully when dealing with some reckless users who are at a point of loosing their streak.
           </p>
           <p>
  Being a smart owl is a demanding job - Duo never sleeps. He is known for his inexhaustible supplies of patience even when dealing with not the brightest of us. His main teaching method is gamification and he always thinks about adding new features to spice things up. His virtuousness knows no limits, hence the latest one encourages friendships through "friend quests" (but also puts them to a test offering an option to buy a gift to the quest-partner for the hard-earned lingots which could be spent in a million of other ways)
           </p>
           <p>
  In his 12-year-career he solely devoted to work at the Duolingo app, he became its most valuable key-player and many simply can't imagine the app existing without him. With his team growing over the years, he now has over 500 people working for him - from language professors, neuroscience specialists, through designers, programmers to markerters and many more! In addition to his numerous qualities, his sophistcated sense of humour has been known to amuse people of all sorts - from pheasants to those with the finest humour palettes.

          <h3>Short and Sweet about Duo:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
    Duo was born in 2011, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, USA
            </li>
            <li>
    A son of two fathers - (German-Guatemalan) Luis von Ahn and (Swiss) Severin Hacker (and his subtle support for LGBT communities is manifested through his work)
            </li>
            <li>
Duo decided to make the majority of his lessons pro-bono, inspired by his father Luis and his stories about his childhood in Guatemala and how expensive and inaccessible learning English for common people over there is.
            </li>
            <li>
              Today, his teachings are followed by nearly 60 million people worldwide
            </li>
